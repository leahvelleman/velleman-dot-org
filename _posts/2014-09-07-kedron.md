Kedron (SH 48) is known to most Sacred Harp singers as a lovely, stark
and simple minor-key tune. So I was startled to see that the [original
version,](http://people.bethel.edu/~rhomar/TunePages/Kedron.html) in the
*United States Sacred Harmony*, is strikingly chromatic in a way unlike
anything else I've encountered in the modern shapenote repertoire.

The tenor line is the same as the familiar one, except for two grace
notes and two accidentals --- but *what accidentals!* The first of the
two, the lowered <span class="title-ref">mi</span> in bar 5, is totally
unique as far as I know: you occasionally hear a lowered <span
class="title-ref">mi</span> in a major-key tune, but I've never seen one
in this tradition in minor. Technically speaking, the effect is to take
us temporarily out of standard Aeolian minor and into the Phrygian mode.
Aesthetically... well, I think it's haunting, though also quite
unfamiliar-sounding (and hard to sing, at least for me).

The alto line has quite a few changes, but there are two that jump out.
I'm very fond of the <span class="title-ref">so</span> in bar 4, which
changes the harmony: it is now a G major chord rather than an E minor.
The raised <span class="title-ref">fa</span> in bar 6, on the other
hand, clashes so dramatically with the melody that it is almost
unsingable unless you raise the melody's <span
class="title-ref">fa</span> as well --- which some singers would do
anyway.

It's also interesting to see the extra grace notes in the tenor line ---
and this time it's not because they're unusual, but because they're so
ordinary. At least one of the two, the one in bar 9, I'm fairly certain
I've heard sung before: it is a sort of embellishment that many modern
traditional singers add without thinking, and seeing it written in here
makes me wonder if it was already part of the tradition then.
